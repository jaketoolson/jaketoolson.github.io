                    <p>I have held key technical roles which have allowed me to interact and successfully support Board members, management, co-workers, clients, and customers. Most of these roles required me to act beyond the job description, often fulfilling responsibilities in sales, marketing, support, training, and more. With this knowledge, I bring a broad and mature understanding of how to bring cross-functional departments together to collaborate, strategize, and achieve goals.</p>
                    <p>I have proven success in entrepreneurship, product innovation, technical leadership, and software development across multiple industries and markets. I enjoy rolling up my sleeves and taking complete ownership of projects and love working with all departments involved.</p>
